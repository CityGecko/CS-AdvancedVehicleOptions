# CS-AdvancedVehicleOptions

This version is 1.8.7, incorporating airatin's updates and additional changes intended to make this mod compatible with More Vechicles by @dymanoid, most importantly using ```Array16<T>::m_buffer.Length``` instead of ```Array16<T>::m_size``` to iterate over the filled length of ```VehicleManager.instance.m_vehicles``` and ```VehicleManager.instance.m_parkedVehicles``` to circumvent the use of preset vehicle limits.

# Testing

I've seen a normal frequency of functional cargo trains in multiple cities of different sizes while using this version locally with More Vehicles and many other mods (to be updated), but please test further before incorporating into the workshop version.
